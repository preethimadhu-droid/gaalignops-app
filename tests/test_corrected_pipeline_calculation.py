Critical Pipeline Calculation Validation Tests
==============================================

PROTECTED FUNCTIONALITY: These tests validate the corrected pipeline calculation
logic using formula: target ÷ (conversion_rate ÷ 100)

DO NOT MODIFY without explicit user permission.

August 2025: Fixed fundamental mathematical error in reverse pipeline calculation.
Previous formula (target × 100) ÷ conversion_rate was INCORRECT.
New formula target ÷ (conversion_rate ÷ 100) ensures accurate pipeline planning.
